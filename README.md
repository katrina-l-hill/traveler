### App Name: Random Travel Location Generator

### Overview

<!-- How the game works:

- the 8 ball is displayed on the page
- the words 'Where should I go?' are printed at the top of the page
- player clicks on the 8 ball to select a location
- a random location is displayed somewhere on the page from the location list -->

This app is designed to generate a random location up on launch into the browser. A random location will be displayed on the screen beneath a list of all locations choices.
